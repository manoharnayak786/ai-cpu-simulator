## üîç Bugs Found & Fixed

### 1. **Critical Bug: Missing Task.remaining Initialization**
**File**: `core_simulator.py` (Line 7)  
**Issue**: The `Task` class constructor was missing the crucial `self.remaining = difficulty` assignment  
**Impact**: Tasks would not track progress correctly, causing simulation failures  
**Fix**: Added proper initialization of `remaining` attribute  
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
def __init__(self, name, difficulty):
    self.name = name
    self.difficulty = difficulty
    # Missing: self.remaining = difficulty

# AFTER (FIXED) ‚úÖ
def __init__(self, name, difficulty):
    self.name = name
    self.difficulty = difficulty
    self.remaining = difficulty  # work left to do
```

### 2. **Critical Bug: Incomplete Core.process() Method**
**File**: `core_simulator.py` (Line 37)  
**Issue**: Missing `return None` statement when no task is being processed  
**Impact**: Method would return undefined value, causing potential runtime issues  
**Fix**: Added explicit `return None` for idle cores  
```python
# BEFORE (INCOMPLETE)
def process(self):
    if self.task:
        # ... processing logic ...
        return finished_task
    # Missing return statement

# AFTER (FIXED) ‚úÖ
def process(self):
    if self.task:
        # ... processing logic ...
        return finished_task
    return None
```

### 3. **Critical Bug: Incomplete run_cycle() Method**
**File**: `core_simulator.py` (Line 92)  
**Issue**: Incomplete line `self.completed_tasks.append(completed)` in the run_cycle method  
**Impact**: Completed tasks were not being properly tracked  
**Fix**: Completed the task completion tracking logic  
```python
# BEFORE (INCOMPLETE)
def run_cycle(self):
    self.cycle += 1
    for core in self.perf_cores + self.eff_cores:
        completed = core.process()
        if completed:
            # Line was incomplete

# AFTER (FIXED) ‚úÖ
def run_cycle(self):
    self.cycle += 1
    for core in self.perf_cores + self.eff_cores:
        completed = core.process()
        if completed:
            self.completed_tasks.append(completed)
```

### 4. **Syntax Bug: Malformed Task List**
**File**: `core_simulator.py` (Line 112)  
**Issue**: Missing opening bracket `[` in task list definition  
**Impact**: Syntax error preventing script execution  
**Fix**: Added proper list syntax  
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
tasks = 
    ("TranscribeDebate", 5),
    # ... rest of tasks

# AFTER (FIXED) ‚úÖ
tasks = [
    ("TranscribeDebate", 5),
    # ... rest of tasks
]
```

### 5. **Performance Bug: Inefficient Core Assignment Logic**
**File**: `core_simulator.py` (Lines 66-86)  
**Issue**: Cores would remain idle even when tasks were available for opposite core type  
**Impact**: Poor utilization leading to unnecessary idle cycles and reduced performance  
**Fix**: Added intelligent cross-type assignment fallback logic  
```python
# BEFORE (INEFFICIENT)
def assign_to_cores(self):
    # Only assigned to preferred core types
    # No fallback for busy cores
    
# AFTER (OPTIMIZED) ‚úÖ
def assign_to_cores(self):
    # ... preferred assignment logic ...
    
    # Additional fallback: Assign cross-type when preferred cores are busy
    # Performance cores can handle light tasks when efficiency cores are busy
    for core in self.perf_cores:
        if core.is_idle() and self.wait_queue_eff:
            core.assign_task(self.wait_queue_eff.pop(0))
    
    # Efficiency cores can handle heavy tasks when performance cores are busy  
    for core in self.eff_cores:
        if core.is_idle() and self.wait_queue_perf:
            core.assign_task(self.wait_queue_perf.pop(0))
```
